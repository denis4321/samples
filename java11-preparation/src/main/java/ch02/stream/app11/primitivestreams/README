IntStream intStream
intStream.boxed() -- Stream<Integer>



The toArray methods return primitive type arrays.
• Methods that yield an optional result return an OptionalInt, OptionalLong, or
OptionalDouble. These classes are analogous to the Optional class, but they have
methods getAsInt, getAsLong, and getAsDouble instead of the get method.
• There are methods sum, average, max, and min that return the sum, average,
maximum, and minimum. These methods are not defined for object streams.
• The summaryStatistics method yields an object of type IntSummaryStatistics,
LongSummaryStatistics, or DoubleSummaryStatistics that can simultaneously report
the sum, average, maximum, and minimum of the stream.
