Reduction

They reduce the stream to a
value that can be used in your program. Reductions are terminal operations. After
a terminal operation has been applied, the stream ceases to be usable.

Operations:
1) count - returns long
2) min(Comparator) - Optional<Object>
3) max(Comparator) - Optional<Object>
We need optional as because the stream happened to be empty
4) findFirst() - returns the first item from stream (for example after filter):
Optional<String> startsWithQ
= words.filter(s -> s.startsWith("Q")).findFirst();
5) findAny() - If you ok with any item accept criteria, not exactly the first one.
Useful in parallel stream
Optional<String> startsWithQ
= words.parallel().filter(s -> s.startsWith("Q")).findAny();
6) anyMatch() - boolean
Just to indicate whether at least 1 item mathes some criteria
boolean aWordStartsWithQ = words.parallel().anyMatch(s -> s.startsWith("Q"));
7) allMatch() - boolean
8) noneMatch() - boolean
