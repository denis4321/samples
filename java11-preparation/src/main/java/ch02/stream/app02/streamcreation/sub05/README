Stateless Stream:
When elements is retrieved from mapped or filteres stream the answer does not depend on the previous elements.


Statful transformations:
1. Distinct:
Stream<String> uniqueWords
= Stream.of("merrily", "merrily", "merrily", "gently").distinct();

distinct is based on equals() and hashCode();
The first item services:
1; Object#1

The stream
must obviously remember the elements that it has already seen



2. Sorting:
Collections.sort() - changes original data;
Stream.sort - does not change original data;
