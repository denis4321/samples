The operation should be associative: It shouldnâ€™t matter in which order you combine
the elements. In math notation, (x op y) op z = x op (y op z). This allows
efficient reduction with parallel streams.

Subtraction is not associative



Reduce with accumulator:
Integer result =  Stream.of(1,2,3,4,5,6,7).reduce(0, (a, b)->a+b);
