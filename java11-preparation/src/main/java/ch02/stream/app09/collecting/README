Since it is not possible to create a generic array at runtime, the expression
stream.toArray() returns an Object[] array. If you want an array of the correct type,
pass in the array constructor:


Collectors:
1. A supplier to make new instances of the target object, for example, a
constructor for a hash set
2. An accumulator that adds an element to the target, for example, an add method
3. An combiner that merges two objects into one, such as addAll

Collectors to Map:
you need to define rules for keys and values:
1.Object::keyField, Object::valueField
2. Function.identity() - always returns own arguments

For each of the toMap methods, there is an equivalent toConcurrentMap
method that yields a concurrent map.
