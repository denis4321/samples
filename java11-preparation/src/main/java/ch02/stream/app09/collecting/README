Since it is not possible to create a generic array at runtime, the expression
stream.toArray() returns an Object[] array. If you want an array of the correct type,
pass in the array constructor:


Collectors:
1. A supplier to make new instances of the target object, for example, a
constructor for a hash set
2. An accumulator that adds an element to the target, for example, an add method
3. An combiner that merges two objects into one, such as addAll
