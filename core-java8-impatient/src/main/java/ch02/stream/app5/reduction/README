Optional if present almost same as null check.

The key to using Optional effectively is to use a method that either consumes the correct value or produces an alternative.
There is a second form of the ifPresent method that accepts a function
optionalValue.ifPresent(v -> Process v);

This is pretty same as Stream.map

If there is no value in optional 

1. Just set default value: largest.orElse(0);
2. Calculate some value:  largest.orElseGet(() -> 0);
3. Throw an Exception: largest.orElseThrow(new Supplier<NoSuchElementException>();
