1. Starvation:
You have created several threads in your application.
To ensure that important tasks are performed quickly,
you have increased the priority of some threads and lowered the priority of others.
At run time, however, you observe that the lower priority threads rarely get a chance to run.  

Starvation occurs when one thread cannot access the CPU because one or more other threads
are monopolizing the CPU. Thread starvation may be caused because of different thread priorities. 
A lower-priority thread can be starved by higher-priority threads if the higher-priority threads do not yield control of the CPU from time to time.


Starvation occurs when a thread is frequently unable to get access to a resource because the resource is hogged by other threads most of the time
